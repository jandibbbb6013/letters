		 	Ashley Dianne,
		 	<br><br>
		 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't express how much I cherish our time <span class="word"> together</span>. Every moment <span class="word"> with you </span> feels like a beautiful journey, creating new memories that I hold close to my <span class="word">heart</span>. When we explore new places or try new things, it adds layers of <span class="word">joy</span> to our shared experiences. 
		 	<br><br>
		 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigating through life together is an <span class="word"> adventure</span>, discovering the hidden gems that make our journey unique. You've shown me how to appreciate the <span class="word"> simple moments</span>, and it feels like unlocking a new level of happiness. Trying to figure out where we are and where we're going adds a sense of <span class="word">excitement </span> to our connection.
		 	<br><br>
		 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tas sa <span class="word"> Valorant</span>, hoping we could play more together with Rodnel, sigi ug katawa sa mga kaboang HAHAHAHAHAHA
		 	<br><br>
		 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have so many secret navigational commands, even when I try to use <span class="word"> autocomplete </span> you frustrate me with all the wrong options. 
		 	Every little typo or mistake I make always leads to a series of error messages that you love to spit out at me. Even though we look cool together at that cool hipster coffee shop youâ€™re just too high maintenance for me.
		 	<br>
		 	I would rather use <span class="word"> cowsay </span>installed through homebrew to talk with cows than to talk with you agian.
		 	<br>
		 	Bye.
		 	<br>
		 	Jen
