				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this message finds you well. I've been meaning to share something with you that's been on my mind. Every time we hang out with Rodnel, it brings me a lot of happiness, and I wanted to express that to you. Even if I'm not always the most expressive person outwardly, please know that inside, I'm genuinely thrilled and grateful for our time together. There's a certain warmth and joy that fills me when the three of us are hanging out, and I value those moments a lot. I appreciate the shared laughter, the easy conversations, and the unique bond that we have when Rodnel is around. It's those seemingly ordinary moments that hold a special place in my heart. Your company adds a layer of comfort and happiness to these gatherings, and I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that. Sometimes, it's the unspoken joys that make our friendships so special. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the prospect of creating more memories together with Rodnel. Whether it's trying out new places, having cozy movie nights, or just enjoying each other's company, I'm all in. Thanks for being a part of these moments, Ashley. It truly means a lot to me, and I'm grateful to have you as a friend. Looking forward to more shared laughter and good times.
